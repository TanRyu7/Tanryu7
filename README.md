# Tanmay Aggarwal

Cybersecurity and Finance graduating December 2025. I like building small, working things that catch bad behaviour and explain risk in business terms.

Current focus
I am standing up a blue team lab with Windows, Sysmon and a SIEM. I am writing a few practical detections with short runbooks, then stress testing them with atomic attacks. I am also building a lightweight risk model that links Essential Eight controls to time and money. Nothing fancy. Useful and auditable.

What I actually know how to use
Windows and Linux admin basics. Python for glue. SQL from uni and projects. Git. Elastic or Wazuh. Sigma rules. Basic IAM. CVSS and exploitability. FAIR style thinking for impact. Excel when a chart is faster than words.

A little about me
I studied Computer Networks, Secure Coding, Defensive Cybersecurity, Systems Programming, Databases and Agile Web Dev on the tech side. I studied Valuation, Investment Analysis, Corporate Finance, Trading and Planning on the finance side. I also ran finance ops for a student society. I am good at turning technical noise into a clear, short note with a next step and a number.
